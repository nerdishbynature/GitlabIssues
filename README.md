Serious Tool

ï¿¼What people expect from a Productivity App as a Serious Tool is that it fulfills a clearly defined task. Your App must quickly fulfill what 80% of the users are going to do with it.
A Serious Tool creates or modifies something, and as a result should be attended to by a hierarchical or multi-window interface. Because your users are going to make something with your application the interface and the graphics have to be minimal. You don't want to complicate the overall experience of your users with unnecessary animation or transitions. You must get straight to the point.
